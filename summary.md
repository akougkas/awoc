# AWOC Production Optimization - Completion Summary

## Requested Task Description

The user requested a comprehensive senior engineer review to transform AWOC from an over-engineered system to a truly lightweight, production-ready framework. The task involved:

- **Reviewing** the current implementation against stated goals
- **Identifying** architectural complexity that contradicted the "lightweight" philosophy
- **Simplifying** all components to match the original incremental development approach
- **Ensuring** consistency between documentation and actual capabilities
- **Delivering** a production-ready system that achieves 100% completion

The optimization focused on eliminating feature bloat, reducing agent complexity, simplifying configuration, and aligning all components with the core philosophy of simplicity and reliability.
