# Collect current context data
current_context=$(scripts/context-monitor.sh status --json)
current_tokens=$(echo "$current_context" | jq -r '.total_tokens')
session_history="${CONTEXT_DIR}/session_history.jsonl"

case "$prediction_type" in
    "overflow")
        # Overflow risk prediction with ML analysis
        task_type=$(echo "$current_context" | jq -r '.task_type // "medium"')
        agent_count=$(echo "$current_context" | jq -r '.active_agents // 1')
        
        scripts/context-intelligence.sh predict overflow "$current_tokens" "$task_type" "$agent_count"
        ;;
        
    "optimize")
        # Optimization opportunity prediction
        scripts/context-intelligence.sh predict optimization "$current_context"
        
        # Pattern-based analysis
        scripts/pattern-analyzer.py analyze --session-file="$session_history" --pattern-types optimization_effectiveness

        echo "$handoff_readiness" | jq -r '.optimal_timing'
        ;;
