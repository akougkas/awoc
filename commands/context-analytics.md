3. **Optimization Automation**: Intelligent recommendations and execution
4. **Risk Assessment**: Proactive overflow prevention
5. **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics and reporting

## Script Integration

```bash
# Execute context analytics
context_analytics_mode="${1:-status}"
context_options="${2:-""}"

case "$context_analytics_mode" in
    "status")
        scripts/context-intelligence.sh status
        scripts/context-monitor.sh analytics
        scripts/context-optimizer.sh status
        ;;
    "trends")
        scripts/pattern-analyzer.py analyze --session-file="${CONTEXT_DIR}/session_history.jsonl" --pattern-types token_growth optimization_effectiveness
        ;;
    "performance")
        scripts/context-intelligence.sh predict patterns
        scripts/workflow-coordinator.sh metrics
        ;;
    "risk")
        current_tokens=$(scripts/context-monitor.sh current | jq -r '.total_tokens')
        context_data=$(scripts/context-monitor.sh status --json)
        scripts/overflow-prevention.sh detect "$current_tokens" "$context_data"
        ;;
    "optimize")
        current_context=$(scripts/context-monitor.sh status --json)
        scripts/context-optimizer.sh autonomous "$current_context"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Advanced Context Analytics - AWOC 2.0"
        echo "Usage: /context-analytics [status|trends|performance|risk|optimize] [options]"
        ;;
esac
```

## Output Examples

### Status Output

Predictive Insights:
  Overflow Risk (5min): 15% (Low)
  Optimization Opportunity: High (87% confidence)
  Recommended Action: Semantic compression within 10 minutes

Performance Metrics:
  Agent Efficiency: 91% (Above baseline)
  Context Optimization: 3 successful optimizations today
  Prevention Success Rate: 94% (7-day average)
```

### Trends Output
```
=== Context Usage Trends (24h) ===

Token Growth Pattern:
  Average Velocity: 180 tokens/sec
  Peak Usage: 14:30 (195,000 tokens)
  Growth Acceleration: +12% vs yesterday
  
Optimization Events:
  Successful: 8/9 (89% success rate)
  Average Savings: 28% token reduction
  Most Effective: Semantic compression (35% avg savings)

```

### Risk Assessment Output
```
=== Intelligent Risk Assessment ===

Current Risk Level: MEDIUM
Confidence Score: 84%

Risk Factors:
  ✓ High token count (156k > 150k threshold)
  ✓ Growth velocity (240/sec > 200/sec threshold) 
  ⚠ Agent overload (3 agents, manageable)
  ✓ Memory pressure (67%, acceptable)

ML Prediction:
  5min forecast: 165,000 tokens (Medium risk)
  10min forecast: 178,000 tokens (High risk)
