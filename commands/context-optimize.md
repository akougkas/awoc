## Target Specifications

### Reduction Targets
```bash
/context-optimize --target=20%    # Conservative optimization
/context-optimize --target=30%    # Standard optimization  
/context-optimize --target=40%    # Aggressive optimization
/context-optimize --target=auto   # ML-determined optimal
```

### Time Constraints
```bash
/context-optimize --max-time=30s  # Standard optimization time
/context-optimize --max-time=10s  # Quick optimization
/context-optimize --max-time=5s   # Emergency optimization
```

### Preservation Requirements
```bash
/context-optimize --preservation=99%  # Maximum preservation
/context-optimize --preservation=95%  # Balanced approach
/context-optimize --preservation=90%  # Aggressive compression
```

## Implementation

The command integrates with the complete AWOC 2.0 optimization framework:

```bash
# Get current context state
current_context=$(scripts/context-monitor.sh status --json)
current_tokens=$(echo "$current_context" | jq -r '.total_tokens')

# Determine optimization mode
optimization_mode="${1:-predictive}"
optimization_target="${2:-auto}"

case "$optimization_mode" in
    "predictive")
        # ML-driven predictive optimization
        scripts/context-optimizer.sh predictive "$current_tokens" "$current_context" "$optimization_target"
        ;;
    "reactive")
        threshold="${3:-80}"
        urgency="${4:-medium}"
        scripts/context-optimizer.sh reactive "$current_tokens" "$threshold" "$urgency"
        ;;
    "emergency")
        time_limit="${3:-5}"
        scripts/context-optimizer.sh emergency "$current_tokens" "$time_limit"
        ;;
    "autonomous")
        scripts/context-optimizer.sh autonomous "$current_context" "$optimization_target"
        ;;
    "maintenance")
        scripts/context-optimizer.sh maintenance "$current_tokens"
        ;;
    *)
        # Show optimization recommendations
        scripts/context-intelligence.sh predict optimization "$current_context"
        ;;
esac

# Update optimization history
echo "{\"timestamp\":$(date +%s),\"mode\":\"$optimization_mode\",\"target\":\"$optimization_target\"}" >> "${AWOC_DIR}/optimization/history.jsonl"
```
